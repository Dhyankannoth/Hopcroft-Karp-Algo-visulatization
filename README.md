# Hopcroft-Karp-Algo-visulatization

An interactive web-based visualization of the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding the maximum matching in a bipartite graph.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates how the algorithm works step-by-step and allows comparison with other matching algorithms to show performance and efficiency differences.

🚀 Features

Generate and visualize random bipartite graphs

Step-by-step or automatic execution of the algorithm

Clear visualization of BFS and DFS phases

Real-time highlighting of matched and augmenting paths

Live statistics: matching size, iterations, and algorithm phase

Compare Hopcroft–Karp with other algorithms like:

Naive Augmenting Path Algorithm

Hungarian Algorithm

Greedy Matching (for baseline comparison)

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 Canvas for graph visualization

Vanilla JavaScript for algorithm logic

Modern CSS for clean, responsive styling

⚙️ Algorithm Complexity

Time Complexity: O(√V × E)

Space Complexity: O(V + E)
